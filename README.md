# DecentraLearn üìö

DecentraLearn is a decentralized e-learning platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) that empowers users to create, enroll, and progress through structured courses powered by Web3 technology. It integrates smart contracts (Rust canisters), Internet Identity authentication, and a modern React-based frontend.

## Key Features

* **Internet Identity Authentication:** Secure and seamless login using ICP's native authentication system.
* **Course Creation (Admin):** Admins can create courses with metadata such as title, description, image, and category.
* **Modular Content Management:** Courses are structured into modules and lessons, enabling an intuitive and organized learning flow.
* **Decentralized Progress Tracking:** Student progress is securely tracked and stored on-chain, ensuring transparency and reliability.
* **Modern Frontend with TailwindCSS:** A responsive and user-friendly interface built using React, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI components.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `DecentraLearn`, see the following documentation available online:

* [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
* [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
* [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
* [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
* [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
* [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd DecentraLearn/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the Project Locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Download the frontend dependencies
npm install

# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

If you want to test the AI functionality, you can use the following command:

```bash
# Start Ollama Server
ollama serve

# Download the model if you haven't already
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

You can then do `dfx deploy` in another terminal to deploy the canisters and start the server.

## Landing Page

When first visiting the site, the user has an option to explore or login. Explore will take the user to the explore page, where they can see all the available courses. The login button will redirect the user to the Internet Identity authentication page.

## Admin Page

As an admin, we have the option to view the courses, modules and students. Furthermore, an admin has the control to create new courses.
